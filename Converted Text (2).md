GRAM POSITIVE VS GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA IN AMR IN CANCERBacteria are divided into two which are gram positive bacteria and gram negative ,they are identified through the process of gram staining, gram positive bacteria stains blue or purple because it contains monosaccharide while gram negative bacteria stains pink or red because it contains polysaccharide. ANTI MICROBIAL RESISTANCE (AMR) Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of micro organism to resist the effect of anti microbial agents such as antibiotics, antivirus and antifungal; it can be caused by genetic factors in microbes, antibiotic use and misuse, environmental factors and healthcare practices.Gram negative bacteria Gram positive bacteriaANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANT GRAM-POSITIVE BACTERIACommon examples are:Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus (VRE)Vancomycin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA)ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANT GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIAThey include:Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-Producing BacteriaMultidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosaRESISTANT PATTERN OF SOME GRAM POSITIVE BACTERIAMRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is a gram-positive bacteria that is resistant to methicillin and other beta-lactam medicines. ,( K., Baggs, J., et al. 2019).VRE (Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus): Enterococcus species can develop resistance to vancomycin, limiting treatment choices. (Nimmo, G. R., & Lye, D. C. 2018).RESISTANT PATTERN OF SOME GRAM NEGATIVE BACTERIA INCLUDE:.Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is resistant to Imipenem and Meropenem. (Mehta et al., 2021)Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL)-Producing Bacteria is resistant to Cefotaxime and Ceftriaxone. PROBLEM OF ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANT IN CANCERElevated Danger of Serious Infections Immune System Compromised: Immune system weakness caused by cancer therapies like radiation and chemotherapy increases a patient's vulnerability to infections from germs that are resistant to treatment. . Adverse Reactions to Treatment Restricted Antibiotic Options: Conventional antibiotics may not work as intended, necessitating the use of less potent or dangerous substitutes, which may come with extra side effects. Extended Hospital StaysExtended Stays: Because resistant illnesses require special care and monitoring, patients may need to stay in the hospital for extended periods of time.In conclusion,antimicrobial resistance is a major threat to cancer patients because it reduces their recovery rate and increase their mortality rate.
