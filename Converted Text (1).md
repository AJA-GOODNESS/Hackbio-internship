Write a short essay of approximately 400 words on central dogma of molecular biology in biomarker discovery, its importance in the field of biomarker discovery as it relates to cancer and any relevant examples or case studies that illustrates its application CENTRAL DOGMA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY The central dogma of molecular biology plays a crucial role in biomarker discovery, particularly in cancer research.. a biomarker is a measurable indicator of the presence or progression of cancer or a response to therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers can be molecules, genes or characteristics of cells that are associated with cancer and can be detected in body fluids or tissues. They play a crucial role in diagnosing diseases, predicting disease progression and tailoring personalized treatment plans.The central dogma begins with DNA, which encodes genetic information. This information is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which then translates into proteins. Proteins, the products of gene expression, perform a wide range of functions and include enzymes and structural components Understanding this flow of information helps in identifying biomarkers that can reveal changes in cellular processes indicative of cancer.Cancer often involves alterations in the DNA sequence that lead to abnormal protein expression or function. These changes can manifest as over expressed or mutated proteins, or as altered levels of specific mRNAs. For instance, in breast cancer, the HER2 gene can be over expressed due to genetic amplifications, leading to the production of excess HER2 protein. This protein acts as a biomarker for HER2-positive breast cancer and helps guide targeted therapies such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) (Salmon et al., 1987)The central dogma also helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms of cancer. By examining changes in DNA, mRNA, and proteins, researchers can identify new biomarkers, understand their roles in cancer progression, and develop new therapeutic strategies. For example, the discovery of mutations in the TP53 gene, which encodes the p53 tumor suppressor protein, has been instrumental in understanding the pathogenesis of various cancers and in developing diagnostic tests ( Vogelstein et al.,2000)Another significant example is the identification of the BCR-ABL fusion protein in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This protein results from a chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, which creates the BCR-ABL fusion gene. This fusion gene produces an abnormal tyrosine kinase protein that drives the proliferation of cancerous cells. The presence of this protein is used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and has led to the development of targeted therapies like imatinib (Gleevec), which specifically inhibits the BCR-ABL kinase (Druker et al. 2001)In summary, the central dogma of molecular biology is integral to the field of biomarker discovery, providing insights into how genetic changes translate into disease markers. By leveraging this understanding, researchers can identify and utilize biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.Reference:Druker, B. J., Guilhot, F., O'Brien, S. G., et al. (2001).
